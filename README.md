The trusted healthcare chatbot project I discussed in the previous question is in progress; therefore, 
I am choosing to display a different personal project. For this, I developed a python-based interactive snake game using the 
public library, Pygame, that challenges the usersâ€™ skill level. It leverages functional programming patterns to encapsulate game logic, 
improve code readability, and improve code testability. I also implemented Pygame documentation to determine the optimal approach to 
capture key presses, enabling new functionality in the game.
